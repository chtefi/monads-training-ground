# monads-training-ground

Mostly examples of the Free and FreeT monads using cats:

There is a sample `App` composed of 7 examples:

- A program and a simple Id interpreter
- The same program using the Future interpreter
- Another program using 3 different interpreters
- An interpreter using State (the State is not part of the dsl, but only of the interpreter)
- Free monads composition
- A program using FreeT with Id
- A program using FreeT with State (the dsl forces the State)
